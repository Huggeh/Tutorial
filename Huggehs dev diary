11) Install Maven?
-yup, helps with building
Windows

    1- Unzip the distribution archive, i.e. apache-maven-3.2.5-bin.zip to the directory you wish to install Maven 3.2.5. These instructions assume you chose C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation. The subdirectory apache-maven-3.2.5 will be created from the archive.

    2- Add the M2_HOME environment variable by opening up the system properties (WinKey + Pause), selecting the "Advanced" tab, and the "Environment Variables" button, then adding the M2_HOME variable in the user variables with the value C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\apache-maven-3.2.5. Be sure to omit any quotation marks around the path even if it contains spaces. Note: For Maven 2.0.9, also be sure that the M2_HOME doesn't have a '\' as last character.

    3- In the same dialog, add the M2 environment variable in the user variables with the value %M2_HOME%\bin.

    4- Optional: In the same dialog, add the MAVEN_OPTS environment variable in the user variables to specify JVM properties, e.g. the value -Xms256m -Xmx512m. This environment variable can be used to supply extra options to Maven.

    5- In the same dialog, update/create the Path environment variable in the user variables and prepend the value %M2% to add Maven available in the command line.

    6- In the same dialog, make sure that JAVA_HOME exists in your user variables or in the system variables and it is set to the location of your JDK, e.g. C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_51 and that %JAVA_HOME%\bin is in your Path environment variable.

    7- Open a new command prompt (Winkey + R then type cmd) and run mvn --version to verify that it is correctly installed.

    8- there seems to be some sort of system caching going on, might need restart/time to flush

12) fix maven dependcy upgrade pgsql driver from 91 to 93
13) create github account
- create git repo https://github.com/Huggeh/Tutorial
- git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Huggeh/Tutorial

14) set bash default term in conemu64

15) set some commit params 
git config --global user.email fredrik.sa.rydh@gmail.com
git config --global user.name Huggeh

16) follow tutorial

git checkout -b spark_demo_step_1 origin/spark_demo_step_1
...
added put and get methods
works!

15) Set up Git Repo for Eclipse
